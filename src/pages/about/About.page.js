                                <p>
                                    I began drawing with my cousin when we were children, sometime before the age of ten. It was not anything
                                    formal-just moments here and there with pencils and paper, filling quiet spaces the way children do.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Life around us was often chaotic and as I grew older the noise of it did not fade. What I did notice, though, was how
                                    deeply aware I was of people. I have always been sensitive to the small things others might miss- the quick
                                    shift in someones expression, the tension in a smile, the micro expressions that pass across a face for only a second
                                    before disappearing again.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Seeing people that closely can be complicated. It can quickly create distance in new relationships, and sometimes
                                    even in the ones that have been there my entire life. Observing so much, leaves a lot to process.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Drawing has become the place where I do that. What started as a quiet childhood activity has grown into something much
                                    more necessary. Its where I slow things down, where moments- past and present- can be examined, understood and sometimes
                                    finally released.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For me, drawing is not only about creating an image, Its a way of making sense of the things I have witnessed, what I have
                                    felt, and what has stayed with me long after the moment itself has passed.
