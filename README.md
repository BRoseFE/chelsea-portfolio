## 🧭 Routing Overview

| Route            | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`              | Home page featuring highlighted artworks and artist introduction |
| `/portfolio`     | Full artwork gallery                                             |
| `/about`         | About page describing the artist and portfolio                   |
| `/artwork/:slug` | Individual artwork page generated dynamically                    |

Navigation is implemented using **React Router**.
Artwork pages are dynamically rendered using a **slug-based routing pattern**, allowing each artwork to have its own URL.

## 🎨 Artwork System

Artwork content is managed through a centralized data module.

Each artwork entry includes:

* title
* year
* description
* slug
* featured ranking

The slug is used to dynamically generate:

* thumbnail image paths
* full artwork image paths
* artwork routes

Images follow a consistent structure:

```
public/artwork/{slug}/thumb.webp
public/artwork/{slug}/full.webp
```

Utility helpers generate the paths automatically so components remain clean and reusable.

## 🧠 Design & Engineering Decisions

* **Centralized artwork data**
  All artwork metadata lives in `src/data/artworks.js`. This keeps the UI components simple and allows artwork content to be modified without touching presentation logic.

* **Slug-based image system**
  Image paths are generated dynamically using utility functions (`getThumbPath`, `getFullPath`). This avoids hardcoding asset paths throughout the codebase.

* **Component reuse**
  Shared components such as artwork cards, buttons, header, footer, and the about section are reused across multiple pages to keep the UI consistent.

* **Semantic HTML**
  Landmarks such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `figure` are used intentionally to improve accessibility and document structure.

* **Deployment configuration**
  A Netlify `_redirects` file ensures client-side routing works correctly when refreshing pages or accessing routes directly.

* **Testing**
  Basic testing files are included via Create React App setup. The primary focus of this project is component structure, routing behaviour, and accessibility.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **React**
* **React Router**
* **CSS Modules**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Netlify (Deployment)**

No UI frameworks or component libraries were used — layout and styling are fully custom.
